the Main layer object contains levels
Each level contains a list with events in order
Current supported events are:
"spawner", "wait", "del"
spawner:
  Using the spawner event, you give a dict of one or more spawners to create
  the keys here are the internal names for the spawners
  each spawner has a type. Internally, there are currently 6 types, but only two are supported
  in JSON so far:
  - "pointExp": Use expressions for the x,y of the spawner; direction and speed of the bullet at creation
  - "expBexp": Use expressions for the x,y of the spawner; dx, dy of the bullet each frame
  - "bExpAbs": Use expressions for the x,y of the bullet each frame
  "delay": specifies the delay in ms between bullet spawns (can be as low as you want, no frame limit)
  "size": size of the bullet
  "minSize": Minimum size of the bullet - not yet implemented into json, will be for a randomizer
  "maxSize": see "minSize"
  "sX": spawner x coordinate (required by most spawner types, so far only bExpAbs does not need this)
  "sY": see "sX"
  "bDir": bullet direction in radians, required by only pointExp so far
  "speed": speed of the bullet in points per second, required by only pointExp so far
  "bX": bullet delta-X formula, executed each frame, required by expBexp so far
        When used in bExpAbs, it is instead the absolute x coordinate
  "bY": see "bX"
bullet:
  Using the bullet event, one can add seperate buttons without needing a spawner
  NOTE: remember that using this means the pattern manager will bind the bullets
        to it's own integrated spawner, meaning c won't be predictable
  "type": the type of the bullet. supports "line", "expRel" and "expAbs"
  "x" and "y": the starting x and y value for line and expRel bullets
  "x" and "y": the formulas for x and y in expAbs bullets
  "dx" and "dy": the dx and dy values/formulas in line and expRel bullets respecively
  "size": the size of the bullet. a int for line bullets, a str for expression bullets
  "borderWidth": see "size", but this instead affects the border width (optional)
  "preTime" and "lifeTime": time before bullet activation and bullet lifetime (optional)
wait:
  using the wait event, you delay all events after it by the specified amount of milliseconds
del:
  Using the del event, you can remove one or more spawners
  Give this event a list with the name of each spawner you want to remove
