the Main layer object contains levels
Each level contains a list with events in order
Current supported events are:
"spawner", "wait", "del"
spawner:
  Using the spawner event, you give a dict of one or more spawners to create
  the keys here are the internal names for the spawners
  each spawner has a type. Internally, there are currently 6 types, but only two are supported
  in JSON so far:
  - "pointExp": Use expressions for the x,y of the spawner; direction and speed of the bullet at creation
  - "expBexp": Use expressions for the x,y of the spawner; dx, dy of the bullet each frame
  "delay": specifies the delay in ms between bullet spawns (can be as low as you want, no frame limit)
  "minSize": Minimum size of the bullet - if no maxSize is specified this is the size
  "maxSize": Maximum size of the bullet - not required
  "sX": spawner x coordinate (required by certain spawning types, all spawning types implemented so far require this)
  "sY": see "sX"
  "bDir": bullet direction in radians, required by only pointExp so far
  "speed": speed of the bullet in points per second, required by only pointExp so far
  "bX": bullet delta-X formula, executed each frame, required by only expBexp so far
  "bY": see "bX"
wait:
  using the wait event, you delay all events after it by the specified amount of milliseconds
del:
  Using the del event, you can remove one or more spawners
  Give this event a list with the name of each spawner you want to remove
